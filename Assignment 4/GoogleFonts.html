<h1>The below paragraph is written using google font</h1>
<p>Google Fonts launched in 2010, quickly becoming the Internet's largest, free, open-source selection of fonts. All Google Fonts are free for commercial and personal use. The Google Fonts website makes it easy for anyone to quickly select and utilize different fonts for their own design needs.</p>

<h2>Who uses Google Fonts?</h2>
<p>
	
Everyone does! Graphic designers, UX designers, researchers, developers, web designers, bloggers, social media managers, entrepreneurs, artists, students, teachers, photographers, and many more. Iâ€™ve seen Google Fonts used on billboards, posters, presentation decks, wedding invitations, websites, and books.
